I study how emerging technologies are reshaping the `art industry`, ranging from the rise of `blockchain-based digital asset markets` to the advancements in `generative AI`

My research questions are initially inspired by personal experiences, which encompass my previous position as a docent at an art museum

Methodologically, my curiosity extends to exploring `the economic value of unconstructured data`. Both image and textual analyses have played pivotal roles in my research endeavors

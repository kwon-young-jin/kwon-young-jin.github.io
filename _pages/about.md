<p><strong>I will be on the 2025–2026 job market!</strong></p>

<p>
My work investigates how <em>emerging digital technologies</em> reshape the creator economy from artists and musicians to scholars, paying special attention to equity and inclusion. I concentrate on two intertwined streams:
</p>

<p><mark style="background-color:#e5d0ff;"><strong>Blockchain-Based Digital Asset Markets</strong></mark></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Study&nbsp;1.</b> Who collects NFTs and how do their portfolios perform across boom–bust cycles?</li>
  <li><b>Study&nbsp;2.</b> Can decentralization narrow long-standing gender and racial gaps in art pricing?</li>
  <li><b>Study&nbsp;3.</b> How do fraudulent behaviors such as wash trading contribute to market crashes? <span style="color: purple;">(Job Market Paper)</span></li>
</ul>

<p><mark style="background-color:#e5d0ff;"><strong>Generative‑AI Creativity &amp; Productivity</strong></mark></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Study&nbsp;4.</b> Large‑language models boost overall scholarly output but may widen gaps between senior vs.&nbsp;junior and native‑ vs.&nbsp;non‑native English researchers, creating a new digital divide.</li>
  <li><b>Study&nbsp;5.</b> How do audiences value artwork co‑created by humans and AI?</li>
</ul>

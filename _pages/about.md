I study how emerging technologies are reshaping the `art industry`, ranging from the rise of `blockchain-based asset markets` to the advancements in `generative AI`

My research questions are primarily inspired by personal experiences, such as serving as a docent at an art museum

Methodologically, my curiosity extends to exploring `the economic value of unconstructured data`. Both image and textual analyses have played pivotal roles in my research endeavors

<p><strong>I will be on the 2025–2026 job market!</strong></p>

<p>
I am an empirical researcher who employs computational methods, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and causal inference on large-scale data, to examine how digital technologies reshape markets.
My doctoral work unfolds in two streams: (i) how blockchain-based decentralized markets transform the creator economy and (ii) how generative AI boosts human productivity and creativity.

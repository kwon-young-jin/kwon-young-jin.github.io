I examine how emerging technologies are reshaping creator platforms, with a particular focus on the rise of blockchain-based digital asset markets and advancements in generative AI.

* `Blockchain-Based Digital Asset Markets`: I explore the “yin and yang” of NFT markets, beginning with an investigation into the different types of NFT collectors and how their investment performance shifts across boom-bust cycles (<b>Study 1</b>). I then examine how the decentralized nature of NFT markets might help address longstanding gender and racial disparities in traditional art markets (<b>Study 2</b>). On the flip side, I also study how these largely unregulated markets enable manipulative behaviors—such as wash trading—that can ultimately contribute to market crashes (<b>Study 3</b>).

* `AI Creativity and Productivity`: In this line of research, I investigate how people perceive and value art co-created by humans and AI, applying techniques from the field of Computational Aesthetics (<b>Study 4</b>).
I also examine how large language models (LLMs) affect knowledge workers’ productivity, with preliminary findings suggesting that LLM use may exacerbate existing disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups—even within knowledge-based professions (<b>Study 5</b>).

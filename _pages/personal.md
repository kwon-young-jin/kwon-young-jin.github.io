Whenever I'm not working, you'll most likely find me engaged in one of these activities:

- Attending musical performances (Fun fact: I've been a devoted Radiohead fan for 18 years)
- Strumming my bass guitar
- Exploring art exhibitions (Fun fact: I served as a docent at art museum)
- Enjoying a good film (Fun fact: I've watched 1,100+ movies to date)
- Bouldering (Fun fact: Level V4 boulderer)
- Swimming
- Grilling and camping (Fun fact: I'm dead serious about cooking the perfect beef steak)

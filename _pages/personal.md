Whenever I'm not working, you'll most likely find me engaged in one of these activities:

`Music`
- Attending live music concerts (Fun fact: I've been a devoted Radiohead fan for 19 years)
- Strumming my bass guitar

`Art`
- Exploring art exhibitions (Fun fact: I used to work as a docent at art museum)
- Enjoying a good film (Fun fact: I've watched 1,100+ movies to date)

`Sports & Outdoor`
- Bouldering
- Swimming
- Watching NBA games in person and online (Not a fan of the Minnesota Timberwolves though...)
- Camping and grilling (Fun fact: I'm dead serious about cooking the perfect steak)

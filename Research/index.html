Antecedents and Consequences of Wash Trading</b> <button class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract1', this)">Abstract</button> </div> <ul> <li>with Alok Gupta, Teng Ye</li> <li><span style="color: purple;">Job Market Paper</span></li> <li>Targeting <i>Management Science</i> </li> </ul> <div id="abstract1" class="abstract-box"> <p>The non-fungible-token (NFT) market, long hailed for frictionless, gatekeeper-free trading, experienced a meteoric rise in 2021–2022 before collapsing abruptly in mid-2022. To identify the forces behind this crash, we analyze 15 million on-chain transactions from 867 leading NFT collections. We estimate that wash trading, a fraudulent self-trade behavior designed to fabricate demand, generated approximately US $33 billion, or 47% of recorded trade volume, and was conducted by just 4% of addresses. Our Local Projections with Instrumental Variables (LP-IV) estimations provide four key results. First, increases in wash-trade volume inflate performance metrics (trade count, trader count, capital inflow, and realized returns) during year 1, forming a speculative bubble. Second, the same activities are linked to significant declines across key performance metrics during year 2, crowding out genuine participation and eroding valuations. Third, these boom–bust dynamics are significantly dampened in collections characterized by a higher share of experienced traders, a larger proportion of long-horizon art collectors, and greater trader-network centrality, implying that informed or socially embedded participants buffer speculative shocks. Fourth, collection-level transaction fees and creator resale royalties deter the entry of wash traders, underscoring the importance of trading frictions while also benefiting creators. Taken together, our findings suggest three policy implications for NFT platforms and regulators: (i) implement real-time wash-trade detection in this largely unregulated market, (ii) disclose market-quality indicators, such as the art-collector ratio and network-centrality scores, to support informed investment decisions and enhance market resilience, and (iii) reconsider recent moves to revoke or make optional collection-level transaction fees and creator resale royalties, given their deterrent effect on wash trading.</p> </div> </div> <div class="paper-container"> <div class="paper-title-line"> <b>(2) From Boom to Bust and Beyond: A Longitudinal Analysis of NFT Collector Performance</b> <button class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract2', this)">Abstract</button> </div> <ul> <li> <b>YoungJin Kwon</b>, Teng Ye, and Alok Gupta</li> <li>Finalizing for submission to <i>Information Systems Research</i> </li> <li>Presented at WISE 2024</li> <li>Presented at INFORMS ISR - ISS Paper Development Workshop 2024</li> <li>Presented at WITS 2023</li> </ul> <div id="abstract2" class="abstract-box"> <p>As digital technologies create new products and services, new market participants exhibit diverse sets of behaviors that are rarely predicted by the singular theoretical lens. IS research has taken the lead in examining user behaviors and developed new measures and even theoretical paradigms to examine emerging products and markets (Bapna et al., 2004). The rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has attracted global attention and significant investment; however, collector/investor strategies and their investment performance in this nascent market remain largely unexplored. This paper systematically analyzes the performance of different collector groups in the NFT market using transaction data from prominent NFT art collections. We examine portfolio returns and realized returns across several collector groups, identified through cluster analysis, where the emphasis was on identifying and interpreting distinct behaviors that might indicate different strategic or tactical investor goals. The study discovers and analyzes trader activities through a significant boom-bust cycle that is discernible through overall market valuation, turnover, volatility, and trading characteristics. The key findings of our study reveal that NFT markets do not show a close resemblance to art collector markets, nor do they exhibit the characteristics of investing markets. In particular, we find: i) Contrary to expectations from traditional art economics, art collectors who prioritize holding NFTs for an extended period (Buy-and-Holder investors) outperform speculators who chase popular NFTs (Popularity Investors); ii) collectors who concentrate their investments in extremely high-priced NFTs (Masterpiece Collectors) underperform, despite the high demand for such NFTs; iii) collectors with extensive trading experience (Active Traders) tend to outperform, but this advantage is limited to those who entered the market during pre-boom or boom periods; iv) outperforming collector groups tend to minimize extrapolation of past returns but maximize participation in early NFT sales. Overall, our research provides valuable contributions to the growing literature on blockchain-based digital asset markets and art economics, offering insights into investor behavior, market efficiency, and the dynamics of boom-bust cycles.</p> </div> </div> <div class="paper-container"> <div class="paper-title-line"> <b>(3) Tokenized Access: How NFT Market Empowers Minority Artists</b> <button class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract3', this)">Abstract</button> </div> <ul> <li> <b>YoungJin Kwon</b>, Agnes Yang, Gautam Ray</li> <li>Finalizing for submission to <i>MIS Quarterly</i> </li> <li>Presented at WITS 2024</li> <li>Presented at CIST 2024</li> <li>Presented at INFORMS Annual Meeting 2024</li> </ul> <div id="abstract3" class="abstract-box"> <p>Web3 has ushered in a decentralized digital ecosystem enabled by blockchain technology, reducing reliance on traditional gatekeepers and intermediaries. This transformation raises a critical question: How does this new environment affect existing gender and racial disparities? To address this, we analyze approximately 27,000 sales and 90,000 offers and bids involving 40,000 NFTs created by 2,500 artists on SuperRare, a leading NFT art marketplace. Our findings offer a nuanced view of the NFT art market: (i) While White male artists continue to dominate in terms of supply volume, their dominance is less pronounced than in traditional art markets; (ii) non-White artists face more pronounced disadvantages in both sales probability and price compared to White male artists, with disparities exceeding those experienced by female artists; and (iii) self-curation (artists' ability to signal quality) plays a critical role in mitigating these disparities, with minority artists benefiting more from verifiable quality signals. A series of robustness checks rules out supply-side explanations, such as artist self-underpricing, indicating that the observed disparities are instead driven by taste-based or statistical biases. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how decentralization intersects with equity in emerging digital markets.</p> </div> </div> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GenAI Creativity and Productivity</code></p> <div class="paper-container"> <div class="paper-title-line"> <b>(1) Large Language Models in Academia: Boosting Productivity but Reinforcing Inequality</b> <button class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract4', this)">Abstract</button> </div> <ul> <li> <b>YoungJin Kwon</b>, Agnes Yang</li> <li>To be presented at Wharton Annual Business &amp; Generative AI Conference 2025</li> <li>To be presented at INFORMS Annual Meeting 2025</li> </ul> <div id="abstract4" class="abstract-box"> <p>Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for their potential to enhance knowledge worker productivity. In this study, we provide the first large-scale empirical evaluations of LLMs’ impact on academic research productivity. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 4,582 computer science scholars across 194 top U.S. universities and analyzing 218,723 research papers published between 2019 and 2024, we find that the introduction of LLMs is associated with about 8% increase in publication output; a gap that persists across alternative measures, including the first-author publications and top-tier conference papers. Our regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analysis further reveals that LLMs not only shifted the average publication level but also accelerated the growth rate of productivity, rising to 3.2% in 2023 and 12.8% in 2024. Notably, junior scholars realize stronger gains than their senior counterparts, with the productivity benefit diminishing by roughly 1% for each additional year of experience. Recognizing that LLMs’ benefits may not be uniformly distributed, we also investigate their impact on non-native English-speaking (NNES) researchers, who have historically faced disadvantages in academic writing (Liao et al., 2024). Difference-in-differences and generalized synthetic control analyses indicate that, following LLM adoption, native English-speaking (NES) researchers produced more papers than their NNES counterparts. Overall, our findings indicate that while LLMs significantly boost scholarly productivity, they also exhibit dual effects, lowering barriers for junior scholars while potentially reinforcing linguistic inequities.</p> </div> </div> <div class="paper-container"> <div class="paper-title-line"> <b>(2) Perception and Valuation of Human-AI Co-created Art: Computational Aesthetics Approach</b> <button class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract5', this)">Abstract</button> </div> <ul> <li>with Alok Gupta</li> <li>Analysis in progress</li> </ul> <div id="abstract5" class="abstract-box"> <p>Abstract coming soon...</p> </div> </div> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sharing Economy</code></p> <div class="paper-container"> <div class="paper-title-line"> <b>(1) Friend or Foe?

This study investigates how bike-sharing platforms influence demand for ride-sharing services, with a focus on platform interaction. To measure this effect, we use spatiotemporally staggered expansions of Citi Bike, New York City’s largest bike-sharing service, as a natural experiment. We examine the treatment effects on ride-sharing services (Uber, Lyft) and Yellow taxi demand across the city. Our novel identification strategy, geographically nearest neighbor matching, is based on 0.38 billion individual trip records. The results reveal a complementary relationship between bike‑sharing and ride‑hailing (Citi Bike stations stimulate nearby ride‑hailing trips) while simultaneously depressing Yellow Taxi demand, pointing to a substitution between ride‑hailing and taxis. This research contributes to the sharing economy literature in Information Systems (IS). To our knowledge, it is one of the first studies to explore interactions between app-based sharing platforms. Understanding how people connect different shared mobility services has never been more important. We argue that this study lays the foundation for future research on sharing-to-sharing mobility interactions.</p> </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 YoungJin Kwon.
